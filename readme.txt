This is a daily backup of XDBAThesis Project.

In this project,we propose a novel prototype of system architecture-Mixed-algorithm Scheduling Platform Based on Bayes-Classifier.
This system addresses the current systems' disadvantage of learning and adapting, making the system has the ability to describe 
the status information and to make a prediction,simultaneously,a reasonable scheduling of resources requests thereupon is achieved 
in a better way.Through testing and evaluation,this programme can be more intelligent in decision-making support on virtual computing platforms.
